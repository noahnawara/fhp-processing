# Project 3: Song Control Wristband
![MYO](/img/myo.png)

With this sketch you can control your favorite song! Play it, pause it, change the speed by using simple hand gestures while wearing the MYO wristband: https://www.myo.com. 
Connect the wristband, choose your song and control it easily with natural gestures: 
<em>SPREAD FINGERS -> Play music</em><br>
<em>FIST -> Pause music</em><br>
<em>WAVE IN -> Speed up music</em><br>
<em>WAVE OUT -> Slow down music</em><br>
<em>DOUBLE TAP -> Keep current pace</em><br>
